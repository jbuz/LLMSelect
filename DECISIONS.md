## [2025-10-31] Initial Security Infrastructure Setup

### Context
The repository is public and needs comprehensive security measures as Priority Zero. The codebase has good security foundations (JWT, CSRF, encryption) but lacks security automation, documentation, and CI gates.

### Options Considered
1. **Minimal approach**: Only add SECURITY.md and basic documentation
2. **Moderate approach**: Add docs + pre-commit hooks + basic CI scanning
3. **Comprehensive approach**: Full security stack with all gates and automation

### Choice
**Option 3: Comprehensive approach**

**Rationale**:
- Public repository requires maximum security rigor
- Problem statement explicitly requires P0 security focus
- Better to over-engineer security than under-engineer
- Early security investment prevents future incidents
- Compliance with industry best practices

**Security Implications**:
- ✅ Prevents secret leaks before they occur
- ✅ Catches vulnerabilities early in development
- ✅ Creates audit trail and accountability
- ✅ Enforces security review for all changes
- ✅ Provides transparency through SECURITY.md

### Reversibility
**Easy** - All additions are additive and can be disabled if needed

### Impacted Files
- Added: `SECURITY.md`
- Added: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Added: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Added: `DECISIONS.md` (this file)
- Planned: `CHANGELOG.md`, `CODE_IMPROVEMENT.md`, `docs/WORKLOG.md`
- Planned: `.github/workflows/*`
- Planned: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Planned: `.github/CODEOWNERS`

### Follow-ups
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflows for security scanning
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Add CODEOWNERS file
- [ ] Create remaining documentation files
- [ ] Test all security gates in CI

## [2025-10-31] Environment Variable Management

### Context
The codebase uses `.env` files for configuration, which is correct, but we need to ensure no secrets ever get committed.

### Options Considered
1. **Current state**: Rely on `.gitignore` only
2. **Pre-commit scanning**: Add gitleaks/trufflehog hooks
3. **Both CI and pre-commit**: Scan locally and in CI

### Choice
**Option 3: Both CI and pre-commit scanning**

**Rationale**:
- Defense in depth - multiple layers of protection
- Pre-commit catches issues before they reach remote
- CI scanning catches issues if hooks are bypassed
- Minimal performance impact (scanning is fast)
- Industry standard practice

**Security Implications**:
- ✅ Double protection against secret leaks
- ✅ Scanning covers both staged changes and history
- ✅ CI failures prevent merging compromised code
- ✅ Visible audit trail in CI logs

### Reversibility
**Easy** - Can disable either layer independently

### Impacted Files
- Modified: `.gitignore` (already correct)
- Verified: `.env.example` (contains only placeholders)
- Added: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (planned)
- Added: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` (planned)

### Follow-ups
- [ ] Install gitleaks in CI
- [ ] Configure pre-commit with gitleaks
- [ ] Document setup in CONTRIBUTING.md (done)
- [ ] Test secret detection with sample secrets

## [2025-10-31] GitHub Actions Security Hardening

### Context
GitHub Actions workflows will be created for CI/CD. Best practice is to pin actions to commit SHAs rather than tags to prevent supply chain attacks.

### Options Considered
1. **Pin to tags**: `uses: actions/checkout@v3`
2. **Pin to SHAs**: `uses: actions/checkout@abc123...`
3. **Pin to SHAs with comments**: Include tag in comment for readability

### Choice
**Option 3: Pin to SHAs with comments**

**Rationale**:
- Maximum security (tags can be moved, SHAs cannot)
- Comments maintain readability: `# v3.0.0`
- Prevents supply chain attacks via action hijacking
- Aligns with OSSF recommendations
- Dependabot can still update pinned SHAs

**Security Implications**:
- ✅ Protects against malicious action updates
- ✅ Provides immutable action references
- ✅ Audit trail shows exact action version
- ⚠️ Requires discipline to update periodically

### Reversibility
**Moderate** - Can revert to tags, but reduces security

### Impacted Files
- All files in `.github/workflows/` (to be created)

### Follow-ups
- [ ] Create workflows with SHA pinning
- [ ] Document SHA update process
- [ ] Set up Dependabot for GitHub Actions updates

## [2025-10-31] Dependency Management Strategy

### Context
Python and JavaScript dependencies need vulnerability scanning and version pinning.

### Options Considered
1. **Manual updates**: Check dependencies manually
2. **Dependabot only**: Auto-generated PRs for updates
3. **Dependabot + CI scanning**: Automated updates + vulnerability checks
4. **Add Renovate**: Alternative to Dependabot with more features

### Choice
**Option 3: Dependabot + CI scanning**

**Rationale**:
- Dependabot is native to GitHub (no extra setup)
- CI scanning catches vulnerabilities in all dependencies
- Combination provides both proactive and reactive protection
- Can enable auto-merge for security-only updates
- Renovate can be added later if needed

**Security Implications**:
- ✅ Automated vulnerability detection
- ✅ Fast response to security updates
- ✅ Audit trail of dependency changes
- ⚠️ Must review auto-merged updates periodically

### Reversibility
**Easy** - Can disable Dependabot or scanning independently

### Impacted Files
- Added: `.github/dependabot.yml` (planned)
- Added: `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml` (planned)

### Follow-ups
- [ ] Enable Dependabot in repository settings
- [ ] Create dependabot.yml configuration
- [ ] Add dependency-review-action to CI
- [ ] Configure auto-merge rules for security updates

## [2025-10-31] SBOM Generation Approach

### Context
Problem statement requires SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation and publication.

### Options Considered
1. **Syft (Anchore)**: Industry standard, supports multiple formats
2. **CycloneDX**: Spec-focused approach
3. **SPDX**: Alternative standard
4. **GitHub native**: GitHub's built-in SBOM generation

### Choice
**Option 1: Syft**

**Rationale**:
- Most widely used in the industry
- Supports both Python and JavaScript ecosystems
- Multiple output formats (JSON, SPDX, CycloneDX)
- Easy to integrate in CI
- Active maintenance and community

**Security Implications**:
- ✅ Provides complete dependency visibility
- ✅ Enables supply chain security analysis
- ✅ Supports compliance requirements
- ✅ Helps with vulnerability tracking

### Reversibility
**Easy** - Can switch to alternative SBOM tool

### Impacted Files
- Added: `.github/workflows/sbom.yml` (planned)
- Generated: `sbom.json` as CI artifact

### Follow-ups
- [ ] Add Syft to CI workflow
- [ ] Configure SBOM generation on release
- [ ] Publish SBOM as release artifact
- [ ] Document SBOM location in README
