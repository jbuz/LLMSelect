## Security Infrastructure Details

### Secret Scanning

**Layer 1: Pre-commit Hooks**
- Gitleaks: Scans staged changes for secrets
- detect-secrets: Baseline-aware secret detection
- Runs locally before code reaches repository
- Installation: `pre-commit install`

**Layer 2: CI Scanning**
- Gitleaks: Full history scan on push/PR
- TruffleHog: Verified secrets detection
- Runs on every commit to main and PRs
- Scheduled daily scans

**Coverage**:
- AWS keys, API tokens, private keys
- GitHub tokens, JWT secrets
- Database credentials
- 20+ secret types detected

### Code Security Analysis

**CodeQL**:
- Analyzes Python and JavaScript
- Security and quality queries
- Results published to GitHub Security tab
- Automated vulnerability detection

**Dependency Auditing**:
- Safety: Python vulnerability database
- npm audit: Node.js vulnerabilities
- Runs on every PR
- Moderate+ severity fails build

### Supply Chain Security

**GitHub Actions**:
- All actions pinned to commit SHAs
- Version tags preserved in comments
- Immutable references prevent supply chain attacks
- Example: `actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11 # v4.1.1`

**SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)**:
- Generated with Syft
- SPDX-JSON format
- Published as CI artifact
- Enables vulnerability tracking

**Container Security**:
- Trivy scanner for Docker images
- Critical and high severity detection
- Results uploaded to GitHub Security
- Integrated with image build pipeline

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Test Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **3 failing auth tests**: Test setup issues, not code issues
   - `test_refresh_and_logout`: 401 response
   - `test_chat_creates_and_reuses_conversation`: 401 response
   - `test_api_key_storage`: 401 response
   - **Impact**: Low - existing code works, tests need fixing
   - **Priority**: Medium - should fix but not blocking

2. **Deprecation warnings**:
   - SQLAlchemy `datetime.utcnow()` usage
   - SQLAlchemy `Query.get()` legacy API
   - **Impact**: Low - functionality works
   - **Priority**: Low - technical debt

### Missing Features (Planned)
1. **No package-lock.json**: Using `npm install` instead of `npm ci`
   - Should generate and commit package-lock.json
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **No lint script in package.json**: JavaScript linting skipped
   - Should add ESLint configuration
   - **Priority**: Low

3. **Frontend test suite**: 0% coverage
   - Part of planned Cycle 9-10 work
   - **Priority**: High (future work)
