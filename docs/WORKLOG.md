# Development Work Log

This file tracks development cycles, progress, and time spent on implementation tasks. Entries are append-only and provide a chronological record of work.

## Purpose

- Track 2-4 hour work cycles
- Document actual vs. estimated time
- Record blockers and decisions
- Maintain accountability and transparency
- Enable retrospectives

## Format

Each work cycle should include:
- Cycle number and date/time
- Planned tasks (from action list)
- Actual tasks completed
- Time spent
- Blockers encountered
- Decisions made
- Next cycle plan

  - Decision log format and templates
  - 5 initial architectural decisions documented
  - Incident response template
  - Rationale for security infrastructure choices
- ✅ Created CHANGELOG.md (5,222 chars):
  - Following Keep a Changelog format
  - Documented v1.0.0 release
  - Planned future releases (2.0-3.0)
  - Version history summary
- ✅ Created CODE_IMPROVEMENT.md (12,130 chars):
  - Backend improvements (type hints, docstrings, etc.)
  - Frontend improvements (hooks, Context API, etc.)
  - Testing improvements
  - Performance optimizations
  - Documentation needs
  - Prioritization guidelines
- ✅ Created docs/WORKLOG.md (this file)
- ✅ Reported initial progress via PR update

### Time Spent
~1.5 hours (documentation phase)

### Blockers
None encountered

### Decisions Made
1. **Comprehensive Security Approach**: Chose full security stack over minimal (logged in DECISIONS.md)
2. **Document Structure**: Created 7 governance documents to establish foundation
3. **Priority Order**: Security docs first, then CI automation, then feature work

### Notes
- Repository has excellent backend foundation (JWT, CSRF, encryption)
- Missing: CI/CD automation, secret scanning, dependency checks
- Test coverage: ~30% backend, 0% frontend (needs improvement)
- Critical gap: Comparison UI missing despite backend support

### Next Cycle Plan
**Cycle 2: CI/CD Security Automation**
- Create .github/workflows directory
- Implement security-scan.yml (gitleaks/trufflehog)
- Implement dependency-review.yml
- Implement ci.yml (lint, test, build)
- Create CODEOWNERS file
- Add pre-commit hooks configuration
- Test all workflows
- Verify secret scanning catches test secrets

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
