This file tracks development cycles, progress, and time spent on implementation tasks. Entries are append-only and provide a chronological record of work.

## Purpose

- Track 2-4 hour work cycles
- Document actual vs. estimated time
- Record blockers and decisions
- Maintain accountability and transparency
- Enable retrospectives

## Format

Each work cycle should include:
- Cycle number and date/time
- Planned tasks (from action list)
- Actual tasks completed
- Time spent
- Blockers encountered
- Decisions made
- Next cycle plan

### Time Spent
~1.5 hours (documentation phase)

### Blockers
None encountered

### Decisions Made
1. **Comprehensive Security Approach**: Chose full security stack over minimal (logged in DECISIONS.md)
2. **Document Structure**: Created 7 governance documents to establish foundation
3. **Priority Order**: Security docs first, then CI automation, then feature work

### Notes
- Repository has excellent backend foundation (JWT, CSRF, encryption)
- Missing: CI/CD automation, secret scanning, dependency checks
- Test coverage: ~30% backend, 0% frontend (needs improvement)
- Critical gap: Comparison UI missing despite backend support

### Next Cycle Plan
**Cycle 2: CI/CD Security Automation**
- Create .github/workflows directory
- Implement security-scan.yml (gitleaks/trufflehog)
- Implement dependency-review.yml
- Implement ci.yml (lint, test, build)
- Create CODEOWNERS file
- Add pre-commit hooks configuration
- Test all workflows
- Verify secret scanning catches test secrets

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

  - anchore/sbom-action@78fc58e2... # v0.14.3
  - aquasecurity/trivy-action@fbd16365... # 0.12.0
  - actions/upload-artifact@a8a3f3ad... # v3.1.3
  - actions/dependency-review-action@6c5ccdad... # v3.1.0
- ✅ Reported progress via git push

### Time Spent
~1.5 hours

### Blockers
None encountered

### Decisions Made
1. **Dual Secret Scanning**: Use both Gitleaks and TruffleHog for maximum coverage (logged in DECISIONS.md previously)
2. **Multi-Version Python Testing**: Test on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 to ensure compatibility
3. **SHA Pinning**: All actions pinned to commits with version tags in comments for maintainability
4. **Minimal Permissions**: Each workflow specifies only the permissions it needs
5. **Scheduled Scans**: Daily security scans to catch new vulnerabilities
6. **CODEOWNERS**: Require review for security-sensitive paths

### Notes
- All workflows follow security best practices from GitHub documentation
- Workflows will trigger on this push - will monitor results
- Pre-commit hooks need to be installed by developers: `pre-commit install`
- SBOM only generates on main branch pushes (not PRs)
- Container scanning runs on all pushes
- Dependency review only runs on PRs to main
- Some CI jobs may fail initially due to missing lint scripts in package.json (expected)

### Next Cycle Plan
**Cycle 3: Verify and Document CI Pipeline**
- Monitor workflow execution results
- Fix any workflow issues discovered
- Add CI status badges to README
- Document pre-commit setup in README
- Create a simple test to verify secret detection
- Update CHANGELOG with CI/CD additions

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
