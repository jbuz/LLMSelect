## 🚦 Risk Management

### High Risk Items 🔴

**Risk:** Streaming implementation complexity  
**Impact:** Could delay Sprint 2 by 1 week  
**Mitigation:** Prototype streaming with OpenAI first, then expand  
**Contingency:** Ship comparison UI without streaming initially

**Risk:** Frontend refactor scope creep  
**Impact:** Could delay Sprint 3 by 1-2 weeks  
**Mitigation:** Clear acceptance criteria, time-box each task  
**Contingency:** Split into 2 sprints if needed

---

### Medium Risk Items 🟡

**Risk:** Test coverage takes longer than expected  
**Impact:** Sprint 4 extends to 3 weeks  
**Mitigation:** Pair programming, test-first approach  
**Contingency:** Ship with 70% coverage, improve iteratively

**Risk:** Performance optimization rabbit holes  
**Impact:** Sprint 6 scope expands  
**Mitigation:** Define clear metrics upfront, time-box optimizations  
**Contingency:** Ship essential optimizations only
